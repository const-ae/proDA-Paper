This directory contains data for the Cox et al. 2014 MaxLFQ publication published with the 
ID PXD000279 on proteomeXchange.

In particular it contains the peptides.txt and proteinGroups.txt MaxQuant peptide / protein quantification file extracted from
the ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2014/09/PXD000279/proteomebenchmark.zip file.

It should also contain the evidence.txt file that was specifically generated for Triqler
using MaxQuant but changing the PSM and Protein FDR to 100% based on the raw experiment
files in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000279/files. Unfortunately,
the evidence.txt file is too big (1.6 GB) to be stored on GitHub.
